            Hogwarts is divided into four houses, each bearing the last name of its founder.<br>
            Throughout the school year, the houses compete for the House Cup, gaining and losing points based on actions such as performance in class and rule violations. The house with the highest end-of-year total wins and has its colours displayed in the Great Hall for the following school year.<br>
            Each house also has its own Quidditch team that competes for the Quidditch Cup. These two competitions breed rivalries between the houses.<br>
            Houses at Hogwarts are living and learning communities for their students. Each house is under the authority of one of the Hogwarts staff members.<br>
            The Heads of the houses, as they are called, are in charge of giving their students important information, dealing with matters of severe punishment, and responding to emergencies in their houses, among other things.
